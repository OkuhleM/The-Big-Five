      <h1 class="heading">Introducing the Big five</h1>
      <p class="firstP">Big Five refers to African lions, leopards, rhinoceros, elephants, and Cape buffalo.<br> The
        phrase
        today is usually
        used to market safaris, but was first coined<br> by big-game hunters more than 100 years ago.
        The term “Big Five” originally referred to the<br> difficulty in hunting the lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and
        African
        buffalo.<br> These five large African mammal species were known to be dangerous and it <br>was considered a feat
        by
        trophy
        hunters to bring them home.<br>
        Due to threats to their environments and the scourge of poaching, the range of <br>the Big Five is not as
        auspicious
        as it
        once was. However, through<br> the dedicated efforts of conservationists, you can still enjoy an authentic Big
        Five
        safari
        in many pockets of Southern Africa.</p>

      <p>There are two extant elephant species: African and Asian elephants. However, some genetic studies<br> suggest
        that the
        African elephant is two separate species: savanna elephants and forest elephants.<br>African elephants range
        from
        eight to
        13 feet in height and weigh over six and a half tons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Elephants Never Forget</b> - Of all land mammals, elephants possess the largest brains.</li>
        <li><b>They Can Distinguish Languages</b> - Elephants exhibit a deep understanding of human communication.<br>
          Researchers at Amboseli National Park in Kenya played
          back the voices of <br>speakers from two different groups — one that preys on the elephants, and another
          <br>that does not. When
          the elephants heard the voices of the group they feared, <br>they were more likely to act defensively by
          grouping tightly
          together and smelling the air to investigate.
        </li>
        <li><b>Elephants Honor Their Dead</b>- The abundant sensitivity of elephants is well documented, but their
          sentient<br> nature is particularly notable in the
          interest they express toward the dead.</li>

      <h1>Facts About Lions</h1>

      <p>Lions are one of Africa’s most recognizable animals and for good reason: more than any other animal <br>in
        the
        African
        wilderness, lions signify courage, strength, and power. Spending up to 20 hours of the <br>day sleeping or
        resting, lions
        are the laziest of the big cats.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>LIONS ARE SOCIAL</b>- Lions are the most sociable of all the big cats. They live in groups called
          prides,<br> which usually consist of related
          females and their offspring.</li>
        <li><b> LIONS DON'T NEED TO DRINK EVERYDAY, BUT THEY DO NEED TO EAT</b>- Lions can go up to four days without
          drinking water, but if available,
          <br>they will drink water every day. Lions do need to
          eat every day. Adult female lions need to eat about 11 pounds of meat each day, <br> adult males eat 16
          pounds
          or more
          every day
        </li>
        <li><b>LIONS CAN CLIMB TREES (IF THEY HAVE TO)</b> - Most lions spend all their time on the ground, but in
          some
          parks across Africa they have learned to <br>climb trees.
          Compared to leopards, they are not very graceful at climbing trees as <br>they are not adapted for climbing.
          Most prides of
          lions do not climb trees, and big males are less likely to climb a <br>tree because they are so heavy. The
          reason why lions
          climb or sleep in trees is to get away from pesky biting flies and insects on the ground.</li>

    <div id="Buffalo">
      <h1>All About The Buffalo</h1>

      <audio id="mySound2" src="/audio/buffalo.mp3"></audio>

        alt="">

      <p>The African Buffalo is massively built with short, powerful limbs and weighing in at up to 1750 lbs (793
        kg).<br>
        The
        hook-shaped horns of the African buffalo, which can grow up to 63" (1.6m) long, are often used <br>to defend
        themselves
        against predators, such as lions, and also to show dominance between the males in the herd.<br> The hard
        shield in
        the
        middle of the male's horns is called the boss.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>African Buffalo do not have very good eyesight but their hearing and especially their smell is
          exceptional.
        </li>
        <li>The African buffalo has a symbiotic relationship with many African birds such as the Oxpecker. They are
          <br>often found
          eating insects off the buffalo and will also warn the buffalo of approaching danger.
        </li>
        <li> A Buffalo never forgives! There are many hunting tales that mention wounded buffaloes setting
          ambushes<br>
          for hunters that
          follow or have attacked them in the past</li>

    <div id="Leopard">
      <h1>All About The Leopard</h1>

<audio id="mySound3" src="/audio/Leopard growl animals089.wav"></audio>

        alt="">

      <p>Leopards are the least social - and perhaps the most beautiful - of the African big cats. <br>They usually
        keep
        to
        themselves, lurking in dense riverine bush or around rocky koppies,<br> emerging to hunt late in the afternoon
        or
        at night.
        The leopard is a graceful animal with <br>an elongated body, relatively short legs and a long tail. After the
        lion, it is
        the next-biggest <br>African cat with an average body mass of between 60kg and 70kg, standing about two-thirds
        of
        a metre
        tall at the shoulder.<br> Leopards in the wild may live up to 15 years. Unlike the lion, the leopard is a
        silent
        creature,
        only occasionally emitting a cough-like call.<br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leopards are astoundingly strong. They are pound for pound the strongest of the big cats.<br> They are
          able to
          climb trees,
          even when carrying heavy prey, and often choose to rest on tree branches during the day.<br> One reason why
          leopards
          sometimes take their prey up in the trees is to ensure lions or hyenas can’t steal them.</li>
        <li>The leopard is the most elusive and secretive of the large felids. They are extremely<br> difficult to
          trace
          and locate in
          the wild.</li>
        <li>Like cats kept as companions, leopards will growl when angry and purr when content. They <br>have various
          vocalisations such
          as a rasping cough which they perform to announce their presence to other leopards.</li>

    <div id="Rhino">
      <h1>All About The Rhino</h1>

<audio id="mySound4" src="/audio/rhinocerus.mp3"></audio>

      <img src="/imgs/rhino.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='/imgs/rhino_hover.jpg',playSound('mySound4')" onmouseout="this.src='/imgs/rhino.jpg',stopSound('mySound4')" alt="">

      <p>Rhinoceroses are large, herbivorous mammals identified by their characteristic horned snouts.<br> The word
        "rhinoceros"
        comes from the Greek "rhino" (nose) and "ceros" (horn) Their horns are sometimes sold as<br> trophies or
        decorations,
        but more often they are ground up and used in traditional Chinese medicine.<br>The rhinoceros is the second
        largest land mammal
        on Earth, next to the elephant. It's also one of the most aggressive.<br>
        But despite its reputation as the bully on the playground, rhinos are vulnerable <br>when it comes to one
        great
        danger:
        humans. Their ranks have drastically dwindled over the past century <br>due to poaching and habitat loss, and
        conservationists are now trying to save them from extinction</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>WHITE RHINOS AND BLACK RHINOS ARE ACTUALLY THE SAME COLOR.</b> - They're both essentially
          grayish-brown.
          One widely<br> spread rumor suggests that white rhinos were originally called wijd
          (wide) by Dutch settlers in Africa, <br>referring to the animal's wide mouth, which was then mistranslated
          into
          English as
          "white."</li>
        <li><b>THEY HAVE A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OXPECKER BIRD.</b> - Rhinos are often seen with oxpeckers
          hitching a ride
          on <br>their backs, but the benefit of these birds is currently
          debated. The traditional argument is that they snack on bugs and ticks <br>that crawl on the rhino's skin,
          but
          in 2000,
          research on cattle failed to find a consistent<br> benefit to having oxpeckers, while a 2004 study on
          captive
          (and
          tick-free) rhinos found <br>that rather than being helpful,oxpeckers spent much of their time picking at
          wounds
          and
          feasting on the rhino’s blood</li>
        <li><b>THEY RISK EXTINCTION.</b> - Just a century ago, there were more than half a million rhinos around the
          world.<br>
          Now, around 30,000 survive in the wild,
          largely due to poaching. All five species of rhino are in danger,<br> but three are considered critically
          endangered:
          Sumatran, Javan, and black rhinos.<br> Today, there are about 60 remaining Javan rhinos, fewer than 100
          Sumatran
          rhinos, and
          about 5500 black rhinos.</li>
